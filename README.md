# Python-Package-Checker-and-Installer
A simple script that I wrote to be used at the beginning of Python Scripts to Verify that they have all of the necessary packages needed to run the script installed. 

## Setup
---
#### Install the latest version of Python

Visit https://www.python.org/downloads/ and install the latest version of Python. As of writing, this is Python 3.11.2 
![download-installer](https://github.com/jaredbergenthal/Simple-Defang-Tool/blob/main/images/download-installer.png)

Once the executable is downloaded, run the installer selecting the express “Install Now” option.


![install-python](https://github.com/jaredbergenthal/Simple-Defang-Tool/blob/main/images/install-python.png)

After the setup is complete, ensure that python is correctly installed. You can do this from the command prompt by openin the command prompt and typing 
```sh
python --version
```

#### Python-Package-Checker-and-Installer

Go to https://github.com/jaredbergenthal/Python-Package-Checker-and-Installer, and from here select the green “Code” button, select download zip, download, and extract the tool. After the file is extracted, you can take this code and add it to any program you wish to share with others but don't want to worry about telling them which packages need to be downloaded. This tool simply takes all the hassle out sharing Python scripts.
